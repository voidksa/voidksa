## About

I build **small, focused tools** that solve real problems -  
minimal on the surface, intentional underneath.

- Browser extensions  
- Windows productivity tools  
- Clean UX · Maintainable code  

Everything I publish is **free and open source**.

## On AI, obsession, and losing track of time 🤖

I wake up thinking about AI.  
I fall asleep experimenting with it.  
Somewhere in between, tools get built.

I don’t build AI-powered products - 
I use AI as a thinking partner, a shortcut, a mirror.

I spend an unreasonable amount of money testing models,  
not because I need them,  
but because they let me build things I once believed  
were years beyond my reach.

Ideas that used to live only in my head  
now exist as working software -  
not because AI replaces creativity,  
but because it removes friction.

The tools I ship stay simple.  
The complexity lives in the process.

Lately, I’ve started questioning something:  
am I a developer using AI…  
or an AI trained on curiosity that learned how to ship?

Either way, the output remains human.
