## About

I build **small, focused tools** that solve real problems — quietly, efficiently, and without unnecessary complexity.

- Browser extensions  
- Windows productivity tools  
- Clean UX · Maintainable code  

Everything I publish is **free and open source**.

## A completely serious note (maybe 🤖)

I don’t build AI-powered tools.  
I build tools *with* AI.

My workflow is deeply intertwined with AI — not as a dependency,  
but as a force multiplier.

I spend a *concerning* amount of money experimenting with AI models,  
using them to turn ideas I once wished I could build “someday”  
into real, practical projects *today*.

The tools themselves remain simple, focused, and human-friendly.  
AI just helps me get there faster.

Lately, I’ve started to suspect something unsettling:  
**I might be an AI model that learned how to ship projects.**

If that’s true, at least I’m trained on clean code and practical ideas 🙂
