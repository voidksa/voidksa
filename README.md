## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m an open-source enthusiast who enjoys **improving existing projects** more than starting from scratch.

- 🔧 Passionate about contributing to **open source projects**
- ♻️ I love **forking, refining, and enhancing** useful codebases
- 🧠 I enjoy reading code, understanding design decisions, and polishing details
- 🚀 I create my own projects occasionally — only when the idea truly deserves it
- 🎯 I value **clean code, usability, and real-world usefulness**
- 🌍 Always exploring tools and projects that are worth making better

## 🛠️ What I Usually Work On

- Improving UI/UX and developer experience  
- Refactoring and optimizing existing code  
- Adding missing features or polishing current ones  
- Fixing edge cases and improving stability  
- Turning good projects into **great ones**

## 🌱 My Open Source Mindset

I believe many great ideas already exist — my goal is not always to reinvent the wheel, but to **upgrade it, refine it, and make it smoother**.  

> Small improvements can create big impact.
